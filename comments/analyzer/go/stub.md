Remember to delete all the stub comments.
Comments that are incorrect or irrelevant make it harder to read the code.

Go developers take documentation [very seriously](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#commentary).
Every comment in the file should be something you would want to read on [https://godoc.org](https://godoc.org) if this were an official package.
