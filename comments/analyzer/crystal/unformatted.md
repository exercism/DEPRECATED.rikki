Hi! It looks like `crystal tool format` is complaining about your code's formatting.

Instead of loosely following styleguides or using third party static code analyzers, developers (like you) can use Crystal's own formatter. It's there so we can enjoy the ease of Ruby syntax with the added benefit of consistency!
